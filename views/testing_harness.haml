  %h1 Testing Harness
  %p
    Onelogin's testing harness helps you get your API diagnosis fast. You will only need the following elements:

  %ol.list
    %li Your oauth bearer token
    %li Your API's URL
    %li A YML file including the users for: create/update

  .box
    %h3 Introduce your oauth bearer token
    %p OAuth 2 bearer token is the suggested SCIM's auth strategy
    .row.gap-bottom
      <input placeholder="Your oauth token" name='oauth_token'>
  .box
    %h3 Introduce your api BASE URL
    %p
      Base URL is the path to follow to your public api, we just add the necessary SCIM endpoints to start testing against it.
      %br
      For example, if your API endpoint for the user Resource is: https://someexample.com/api/v1/public/Users, input
      %br
      %b https://someexample.com/api/v1/public
      in the box below

    .row.gap-bottom
      <input placeholder="Your API Base URL" name='base_url'>
  .box
    %h3 Introduce your fixture users
    %p
      Because different partner's systems have their own specs on what a user needs to be valid, upload here a YAML file
      containing the needed user attributes.
    .row.gap-bottom
      <input type="file" placeholder="" name='user_fixture'>
